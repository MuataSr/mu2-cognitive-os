        "To facilitate cell communication"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "To control what enters and exits the cell",
      "explanation": "The cell membrane is selectively permeable to certain molecules, allowing some to pass through while blocking others.",

        "Through roots",
        "They don't - photosynthesis doesn't require CO2"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "They don't - photosynthesis doesn't require CO2",
      "explanation": "Plants obtain CO2 through stomata and use it to build glucose during photosynthesis. They don't need to get CO2 from the air for this process.",
